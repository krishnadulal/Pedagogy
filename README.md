Developing suitable pedagogical methods for various classes,
intellectual calibres and research in e-learning
1. Project Outline

1.1 A collaborative project

This project is an experiment to systematically design and develop learner-centric curricula,
suitable for outcome-based learning for 4 year degree programmes in six major engineering
disciplines. This project is NOT, yet another attempt to develop content, although each
curriculum document is expected to include around 80 pages of course notes and 120-125 self
assessment problems and solutions. All development and review activities will be carried out
collaboratively, using a specially designed web tool. A large number of motivated and
experienced faculty members trained in pedagogy of teaching-learning, drawn from a diverse
range of institutions across the nation are expected to participate in the development and the
review process. The decision to involve such a wide section of faculty experts across India is
deliberate, mainly to enhance acceptance and ownership.

1.2 Who are the beneficiaries?

Eventually, these or modified versions of these documents, are expected to be available in the
departmental websites of all engineering degree awarding institutions. These documents are
primarily meant for students, telling them (long before the commencement of academic
sessions) what knowledge, skills and attitudes they should be able to demonstrate on
completion of each course, where to find the necessary learning resources (in addtion to
approximately 80 pages of in-built course notes) and also providing them with opportunities for
self assessment (around 120 – 125 practice problems / assignments with solutions). Used
innovatively, these documents can promote self and group learning; can teach students how to
work in small collaborative groups and how to learn on their own. All faculty members, in
particular, those who may have to teach such a course for the first time, are likely to find these
documents extremely useful. Since terminal objectives and learning resources will be carefully
selected and explicitly stated, all stake holders – students, teachers, (paper setters and
examiners in affiliated college systems) and potential employers are likely to benefit very
significantly. Evaluation of student achievement can be made more valid and reliable as the
benchmark of achievements is explicitly stated. Every institution who decides to implement this
innovation is likely to find compliance with NBA requirements much easier. 

1.3 What is the most significant deliverable?

By the end of the main phase of the project in March, 2016, a total of 200 curriculum documents
of one semester long courses (equivalent to 40x1 hour classroom lessons) in CE, EE, ME, ECE,
CSE and Chem. E disciplines, written in terms of Specific Instructional Objectives should be
available as Open Educational Resource (OER) on the project website pedagogy.iitkgp.ernet.in.
Anyone who wishes to use these may do so with full right to adopt / modify these courses to suit
their own purpose. Provision to update these courses on a continuing basis, using a modified
form of crowd sourcing method is under active consideration. These curriculum documents are
not prescriptive in nature, nor do they represent the views of the institution/ department to which
the development team belongs. These are examples created by expert faculty members drawn
mostly from tier one institutions such as the IITs NITs, good universities and reputed institutions
of national standing. They may, however be adopted/ adapted by those institutions who believe
that their Mission, Vision and PEOs are close enough to the stated Mission, Vision and the
PEOs. For potential users, the methodology is no less important than the final output as they
may wish to modify an existing course to suit their Institution’s Mission and Vision and the PEO
of their own programme. They could act as guidelines for others who wish to develop their own
curricula. The brief given to the curriculum development teams is to design and develop
curricula, keeping academic requirements as the prime consideration, rather than be restricted
by existing syllabus being followed in their own institutions.
There will be around 25 departmental core and selected elective (3rd to 8th semester level)
courses in each of the 6 disciplines mentioned above. Around 25 additional (3rd to 8th semester
level) courses from other disciplines (Architecture / Mining etc.), depending on the expression of
interest by competent experts are also planned. In addition to the above 175 courses, around 20
to25 common 1st to 3rd semester level courses ( Physics, Chemistry, Maths, HSS,
Management, Programming etc.) are also to be taken up.
